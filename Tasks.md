1. [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a game for zero :confused: players and consists of a surface, devided in cells. Every cell is [dead or alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRvCvsRp5ho). The game is played in turns. Every turn depends on the state of the game in the previous turn following these rules:

  - Every cell with less than two living neighours dies(of loneliness).
  - Every living cell with more than three living neighbours dies(too crowded).
  - Evey living cell with two or three living neighbours stays alive for the next turn.
  - Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbours comes back to live.
  
  Your task is to simulate this game. The initial state of the surface should be hard-coded. On every turn the state of the     cells should be written to the console: 'X' for a living cell, ' ' for a dead cell.

10. How many `islands and peninsulas` are there on the "map"?

You are given a numbers `n`, `m` and a `nxm` matrix that consists of numbers `0 through 9`. Your task is to create a program that says `how many` islands and peninsulas are there. These are the 'rules':

  - 0 is water
  - 1-9 is the height of the ground
  - Islands are pieces of land connected by different grounds
   Example of an island:
   ```
   000000000000
   000001100000
   000012321000
   000011210000
   000000100000
   000000000000
   ```
  - Peninsulas are like islands but on the edge of the 'map'.
   Example of a peninsula:
   ```
   984321000
   544200000
   321000000
   100000000
   ```
  - Note that we don't actually care if the land is an island or peninsula. We care about the number of different connected lands.
   
Example input:
```
10 5

4321000020
3210000010
2100000000
2100000000
1000010001
```
Output should be:
```4```

## Complex tasks
1. Tisho wants to play [Bulls and cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows), but he is confused by the rules, so he needs ouр help. We have to write a program that reads two integer numbers `A` and `B` in the range \[0,9999\] from the console and prints back the number of bulls and cows for these numbers. Numbers smaller than 1000 we should pad with zeros, for example 19 should be interpreted as 0019.

1. Tisho really enjoyed our help and he needs us again. Now he asked us to do the following:
Given a number `A`- Tisho's suggestion for his opponent's number,`b`-number of bulls and `c`- number of cows, we have to print every number `N` that has `b` bulls and `c` cows with the number `A`.

1. Strahil and Pesho really love hamburgers. And they have a game, which they play in rounds - they try to eat as much as they can. And since it is very hard to overeat, they can't remember how many burgers they ate, so they write the result in a single number `B` with the following format:
The sum of the left digits of `B` gives the number of burgers Strahil ate, and the sum of the right digits gives the burger count for Pesho. For example 3489 means that Strahil ate 3 + 4 = 7 and Pesho ate 8 + 9 = 17.
If the number `B` has odd number of digits, then the one in the middle is shared between them both. For example 324 means 3 + 2 = 5 for Strahil and 2 + 4 = 6 for Pesho.
The number `B` will never be more than 9 digits long.
Your task is to help them decide who is better and print who won the game and how much burgers he ate. If they have equal results, print that the result is even.
