This list contains a list of tasks for you to do at home or during uni-hours.

## Hello, world!

1. Write a program which prints 'Hello, [whatever yourn name is]!'
1. Write a program which asks the user to enter his name and then print 'Hello, [whatever the user entered]!'

## Primitive data types

1. Write a program which asks the user for length of side of a triangle and the corresponding height and prints the area of the triangle.
1. Write a program which asks the user for a **5-digit** number and then prints:
  - the same number in binary
  - the same number in hex
  - the same number in oct
1. Write a program which asks the user for three numbers `s`, `d` and `n` and prints the sum of the first `n` numbers of arithmetic progression with starting number `s` and difference `d`.

## Conditionals (if/switch)

1. Write a program that asks the user about how many points he scored on his Calculus exam and print the corresponding grade according to the following table:

| Student points      | Expected output |
| --------------      | --------------- |
|  0 <= points <=  20 | 2! Please try again in September                                |
| 21 <= points <=  40 | 3! Whew, that was a close one                                   |
| 41 <= points <=  60 | 4! Not much I can say, you are just a regular fellow            |
| 61 <= points <=  80 | 5! If only you didn't go drinking the night before the exam...  |
| 81 <= points <= 100 | 6! There's no way you did this by yourself, how did you cheat?  |

1. Write a program which asks the user for a command (a number between 1 and 4). Available commands are:
  1. Addition - If the user selects addition, your program should ask for two other numbers and print 'Their sum is: [sum of the numbers]'
  1. Multiplication - If the user selects multiplication, your program should ask for two other numbers and print 'Their multiple is: [sum of the numbers]'
  1. Power - If the user selects power, your program should ask for two other numbers and print '[first number] to the power of [second number] is [the first number to the power of the second]'

## Loops (for/while)

1. Write a program which asks the user for a number `n` and prints the first `n` numbers of Fibonacci.

## Arrays

TBA

## Functions and recursion
